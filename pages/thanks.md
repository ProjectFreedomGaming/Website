### Thanks/Greetings to:

- [Panic](https://panic.com) for the [Playdate](https://play.date) which got me back into game programming and motivated me to do this project.
- [Fabien Sanglard](https://fabiensanglard.net) for his **Book of CP-System** which got me even more curious about the hardware side of game development and motivated me.
- My friend **Garret Foster** for telling me “**You should totally do this…**” when I told him about this how crazy this idea sounded.
- My friend **Pierre Adane** for his insight on old school computer/console architectures and the great lunch conversations.
- [Will Green](https://github.com/WillGreen) for his [Project F blog](https://projectf.io/] which gave me a huge leg up in starting to design the graphics chip in FPGA.

Couldn't have done it without you guys...

With ❤️ from Paris, France.
