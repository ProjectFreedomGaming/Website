    question: What is it?
    what: <b>Project Freedom</b> is a fantasy console, much like <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">pico8</a>, <a href="https://tic80.com">tic-80</a> or <a href="https://www.arduboy.com">arduboy</a>, but for the <a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket">Analog Pocket</a> platform. There isn't much to see here but the main purpose of this site is to host a <a href="/blog/">blog</a> so that the journey can be documented.
